# Disney Clone App

Hey there! üëã Welcome to the Disney Clone app repository, where we're bringing the magic of Disney to life in a web application. Let's dive into what makes this project special:

## Key Features

1. **Caching:** 
   - We've implemented a clever caching system to speed up data loading. No more waiting around for data to fetch every time you open the app. Cached data ensures a smoother user experience!

2. **ShadCN Integration:**
   - Ever heard of ShadCN? It's our secret sauce for crafting stunning UI components. With ShadCN, we've created sleek, eye-catching designs that'll make you feel like you're right in the heart of Disneyland.

3. **Component Management:**
   - Managing components is like mastering a magic spell. We've learned how to reuse a single component but give it different looks and behaviors on different pages. It's like having two components in one!

4. **AI Assistant (Planned):**
   - Imagine having your own Disney guide at your service! We're working on bringing an AI Assistant to the app to enhance your experience even further. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting feature!

5. **Clean Architecture:**
   - We take pride in our clean code castle! This project is not just about visuals; it's about building a solid foundation. With the first full clean app in Next.js, we're learning, growing, and organizing our code like never before.

4. **API Configuration:**
   - To fetch movies, we're using the TMDB database and its APIs.
   - If you're running the app locally, you'll need to set up your TMDB API key.
   - Create a .env.local file in the project root and add the following line:

   ```bash
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here

6. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
